# A Year of Research

A week-by-week progress report seemed a good way to keep track of my research's progress, so I am updating this article every week with one sentence on my big-picture progress.

## December 2020

Week 1 (7/12/20): I watched Brady Neal's causal inference (CI) course up to week 7, read about propensity weighting, the variational autoencoder (VAE) and their time series counterparts.

Week 2 (14/12/20): I read about time-varying treatments and inverse propensity weighting (IPW) on Causal Inference: What If, World Models, a survey on model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and a survey on causal learning.

Week 3 (21/12/20): I prepared a reading list of NeurIPS 2020 papers related to CI and reinforcement learning (RL), and experimented with forward, backward and inverse models for MBRL on the LunarLander game.
