# On the Technique of Boredom

We all want to be productive, yet know how difficult and tiring it can be. I propose that boredom is an easy technique to employ that pushes us either towards productivity or creativity.

## Being productive is difficult.



## Common strategies don't work.

Deleting social media, setting healthy habits, imposing rewards and punishments, having accountability buddies, quitting gaming, are all commonly proposed strategies that if you've tried it, you know can be difficult and tiring, sometimes ineffective and even infeasible.

## Boredom pushes you to do things.

Think of the last time you were bored, which caused you to come up with some creative ideas. When you're bored, you think of things to keep yourself occupied or do something.

## However, boredom is never utilised.

However, many people, when bored, by default redirect to distractions such as scrolling social media.

## Boredom is an easy source of energy.

If you want to be bored, just don't do anything. Compare that with avoiding the temptation of distrations! Learning to be creative by brainstorming idea lists every morning,

## The uncomfortable feeling of boredom is a feature and not a bug.

The more bored you become, the more energy you gain.

## Use boredom to channel energy towards productivity and creativity.
