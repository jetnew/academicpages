I'm a computer science undergraduate, minor in statistics, at the National University of Singapore, and enrolled in the University Scholars Programme.

I'm currently researching causal reinforcement learning under Prof. Harold Soh at the Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) lab as an undergraduate researcher.

In my free time, I'm the Workshops Director at NUS Statistics Society, leading a team of 10 to deliver data science workshops in NUS.

I previously interned as a machine learning engineer at Grab and IMDA.
