I'm a computer science undergraduate with a statistics minor at the National University of Singapore, also enrolled in the University Scholars Programme. I am researching causal reinforcement learning under Prof. Harold Soh at the Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Robots (CLeAR) lab as an undergraduate researcher. I am the Workshops Director at NUS Statistics Society, having directed 5 (and more coming) data science workshops to university students and industry professionals. I previously interned as a machine learning engineer at Grab and IMDA.
