# about me

I'm a computer science undergraduate under the University Scholars Programme at the National University of Singapore. I currently research model-based reinforcement learning, supervised by Prof Harold Soh. I previously interned as machine learning engineer at Grab (2020)and IMDA (2019). In my free time, I deliver data science workshops at NUS Statistics Society and Google Developer Student Club.
