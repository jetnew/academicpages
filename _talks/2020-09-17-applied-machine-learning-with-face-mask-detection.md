Have a real-world problem you want to solve with machine learning (ML), but don‚Äôt know where to begin? Fret not - In our project-driven workshop, we will cover everything from picking the right ML tools, sourcing or even creating your own dataset, model training, all the way to deploying it on a web server to be viewed as an interactive, demonstrable product. At the end of the workshop, you can expect to take away your very own Face Mask Detector that you can enhance in any direction you might like. Join us on 18 September to build and deploy your face mask detectorüëç

Table of contents:
- Data collection, pre-processing and image augmentation
- Transfer learning and model building using Keras
- Model limitations and ethics
- Systems-level project overview & potential commercial value
- Giving it a ‚Äúface‚Äù - Model integration in the Face Mask Detector
