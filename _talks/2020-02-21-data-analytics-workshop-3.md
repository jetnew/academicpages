#### Workshop 3 - Data Visualization and Pre-processing

After data has been collected, we would usually want to inspect and visualize what we have gathered before carrying our any modeling or even trying to present the data. In this workshop, you will learn to present the data using powerful libraries such as Matplotlib and using the insights gleaned to do data pre-processing which is an important step before we can carry out any form of modelling.

#### Topics covered:
- Matplotlib
- More on Pandas DataFrames
- Data pre-processing
