#### Workshop 4 - Machine Learning

After you have done a large amount of work manipulating, analysing and cleaning your data, it is time for your data to do the work for you. In this 4th workshop on Data Analytics, we tackle the most well-known Machine Learning techniques out there and use them to create powerful models that allows us to make predictions with all those data.
But creating your model is only the first step, how do you know whether your model worked? That is where evaluating and validation comes into play. Join us to learn more about validation and see your model improve as it gets “trained”.

#### Topics covered:
- Machine learning models (linear regression, logistic regression, K-means clustering)
- Model evaluation (train-test split, confusion matrix, F1 score)
