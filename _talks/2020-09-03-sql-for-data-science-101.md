In this workshop, we employ a questions-based approach to learning SQL for data science. We introduce basic relational database architectures and demonstrate basic queries using SELECT, FROM and WHERE statements to retrieve data that is relevant to your needs. Join us as we learn to have fun writing queries to answer important questions in data science!
