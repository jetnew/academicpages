As part of the iNTUition Hackathon 2019, this project was awarded Best AI Hack.

Inspired by recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning, I believed that the "Chosen One" stickman in a viral video from 2007 can now be brought to life.

In this project, train 2 RL agents, the Chosen One and a Gun. The Chosen One trains adversarially against the Gun, and while the Gun learns to aim at the Chosen One, the Chosen one learns to avoid gunshots.

After 1 night of training, the Chosen One displayed signs of learnt behaviour. It learnt to camp at a corner when the Gun shoots randomly, reducing its chance of being shot. Over time, it learnt to dodge gunshots as well.

In the future, we hope to extend the agent's behaviours, such as having more weapons for the Gun to choose and learn, and more fine-grained movement mechanics for the Chosen One to master, or even having the Chosen One learn to attack back at the Gun.
